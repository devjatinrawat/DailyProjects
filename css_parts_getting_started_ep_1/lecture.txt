

- three ways to write css
- Inline css = element style ,
Drawback Example if there are 10 paragrphs 
so i will be have to write style for all 10 paragraphs which is not good .
as it go opp to DRY Principle . DRY  stands for Don't Repeat Yourself.
- 2nd way is internal STYLE or embedded CSS ::::
give a style attribute , it follows style atrribute write once.
Drawback : for every page you will have to give color red.
Not Recommended

- External CSS 
- how css page is loaded to our frontend - browser sent request to html
and server send back the response with the data of that requested file (html , css)
- 404 not ok, 304 ok
- user Agent stylesheet provided by browser  itself like default font and colors etc..
- properties
